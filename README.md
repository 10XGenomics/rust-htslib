# HTSlib bindings for Rust

This library provides HTSlib bindings and a high level Rust API for reading and writing (soon) SAM/BAM files.
It is still a work in progress.

To clone this repository, issue

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/christopher-schroeder/rust-htslib.git
```

ensuring that the HTSlib submodule is fetched, too.
